A Powerline style prompt for your shell
=======================================

A [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) like prompt for Bash, ZSH and Fish.
Please refer to [milkbikis powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell), this is a fork that I keep for myself.

changes:
-----
+ smarter git prompt borrowed from [magicmonty bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)
+ changes to default theme colours
+ detection of root user directly in username.py
